We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria.

Those 2 data set contains Locality information of Toronto, different age group of people in the people, population.\n\nTo solve the problem I am going to use \u201cK-Means Clustering Algorithm \".\nK-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity. The results of the K-means clustering algorithm are:\n\nThe centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data\nLabels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster)\n\nAlso, I will be utilizing different maps in-order to give a clear vision to the target audience.\n\n\nSteps we took for the analysis:\n* Collected required **data: location and type (category) of every restaurant within our lat and lng. We have also the type of resutaurants in particu;ar locality.\n\n\n* Explrored the '**restaurant density**' across different areas of Toronto - we will use **K- mean** to identify a few promising areas close to center with low number of restaurants and their type.\n\n\n* Explored the most promising areas and within those create **clusters of locations that meet some basic requirements** established in discussion with stakeholders: we will take into consideration locations with **less restaurants in radius of 500 meters**, We will present map of all such locations but also create clusters (using **k-means clustering**) of those locations to xplore neighborhood.",

Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\n\nFinal decission on optimal restaurant location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location (proximity to park or water), levels of noise / proximity to major roads, real estate availability, prices, social and economic dynamics of every neighborhood etc.",
